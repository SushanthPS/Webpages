        <img title="Edge computing" src="https://www.ikangai.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/edge-computing.jpg">
        <p>Formerly a technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, 
            with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud 
            dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more 
            and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it’s no longer the emerging technology. 
            Edge is. Move over, cloud computing, and make way for the edge.<br><br>
        
            As the quantity of data we’re dealing with continues to increase, we’ve realized the 
            shortcomings of cloud computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help 
            solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing 
            and getting data to a data center for processing. It can exist “on the edge,” if you will, 
            closer to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to 
            process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a 
            centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini datacenters. 
            Edge computing will increase as use the Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases. 
            By 2022, the global edge computing market is expected to reach $6.72 billion.
            As with any growing market, this will create job demand, primarily for software engineers.<br><br><br> </p></div>
    
        <div class="textimg"><h2 class="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality#The_difference_between_Virtual_Reality_&_Augmented_Reality" >6. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</a></h2>
        <img title="VR and AR" src="https://arpost.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Business-Applications-of-Virtual-and-Augmented-Reality.jpg">
        <p>Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user in an environment while Augment Reality (AR) 
            enhances their environment. Although VR has primarily been used for gaming thus far, 
            it has also been used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation software used to 
            train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains. The popular Pokemon Go is an example of AR.<br><br>
        
            Both have enormous potential in training, entertainment, education, marketing, 
            and even rehabilitation after an injury. Either could be used to train doctors to do surgery, 
            offer museum-goers a deeper experience, enhance theme parks, or even enhance marketing, 
            as with this Pepsi Max bus shelter.<br><br>
        
            According to an article at Monster.com, the demand for job candidates with VR knowledge is up 37 percent,
             but the potential employees are in short supply. That demand will only increase. 
             There are major players in the VR market, like Google, Samsung, and Oculus, but plenty of startups are 
             forming and they will be hiring—or trying to, in light of the shortage. Getting started in VR doesn’t 
             require a lot of specialized knowledge. Basic programming skills and a forward-thinking mindset can land a job, 
             although other employers will be looking for optics as a skill-set and hardware engineers as well.<br><br><br></p></div>
    
        <div class="textimg"><h2 class="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security" >7. Cyber Security</a></h2>
        <img title="Cyber Security" src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2691568.jpg">
        <p>Cybersecurity might not seem like emerging technology, given that it has been around for a while, 
            but it is evolving just as other technologies are. That’s in part because threats are constantly new. 
            The malevolent hackers who are trying to illegally access data are not going to give up any time soon,
             and they will continue to find ways to get through even the toughest security measures. 
             It’s also in part because new technology is being adapted to enhance security. 
             Three of those advancements are hardware authentication, cloud technology, and deep learning, according 
             to one expert. Another adds data loss prevention and behavioral analytics to the list. As long as we have hackers,
              we will have cybersecurity as an emerging technology because it will constantly evolve to defend against 
              those hackers.<br><br>
            
            As proof of the strong need for cybersecurity professionals, the number of cybersecurity jobs is growing 
            three times faster than other tech jobs. However, we’re falling short when it comes to filling those jobs.
             As a result, it’s predicted that we will have 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2021.<br><br>
            
             Many cybersecurity jobs pay six-figure incomes, and roles can range from the ethical hacker to 
             security engineer to Chief Security Officer, offering a promising career path for someone 
             who wants to get into and stick with this domain.<br><br><br></p></div>
    
        <div class="textimg"><h2 class="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" >8. Internet of things</a></h2>
        <img title="Internet of things" src="https://pixelz.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iot-internet-of-things-map-uhd-4k-wallpaper.jpg">
        <p>Although it sounds like a game you’d play on your smartphone, the Internet of Things (IoT) is the future. 
            Many “things” are now being built with WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and 
            to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. IoT enables devices, home appliances, cars and much more 
            to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet. And we’re only in the beginning stages of IoT: 
            The number of IoT devices reached 8.4 billion in 2017 is and expected to reach 30 billion devices by 2020.<br><br>
        
            As consumers, we’re already using and benefitting from IoT. We can lock our doors remotely if we forget 
            to when we leave for work and preheat our ovens on our way home from work, all while tracking our fitness 
            on our Fitbits and hailing a ride with Lyft. But businesses also have much to gain now and in the near future. 
            The IoT can enable better safety, efficiency, and decision making for businesses as data is collected and analyzed. 
            It can enable predictive maintenance, speed up medical care, improve customer service, and offer benefits 
            we haven’t even imagined yet. However, despite this boon in the development and adoption of IoT, experts say 
            not enough IT professionals are getting trained for IoT jobs. An article at ITProToday.com says we’ll need 
            200,000 more IT workers that aren’t yet in the pipeline, and that a survey of engineers found 25.7 percent 
            believe inadequate skill levels to be the industry’s biggest obstacle to growth.<br><br>
        
            For someone interested in a career in IoT, that means easy entry into the field if you’re motivated, 
            with a range of options for getting started. Skills needed include IoT security, cloud computing 
            knowledge, data analytics, automation, understanding of embedded systems, device knowledge, to name 
            only a few. After all, it’s the Internet of Things, and those things are many and varied, meaning the 
            skills needed are as well.<br><br>
        
            Although technologies are emerging and evolving all around us, these eight domains offer promising 
            career potential now and for the foreseeable future. And all eight are suffering from a shortage of 
            skilled workers, meaning the time is right for you to choose one, get trained, and get on board at the 
            early stages of the technology, positioning you for success now and in the future.<br><br><br></p></div>
