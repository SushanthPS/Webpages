    <h2 id="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" >1. Artificial Intelligence</a></h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in recent years, 
        but it continues to be a trend to watch because its effects on how we live, 
        work and play are only in the early stages. In addition, other branches of AI have developed,
        ding Machine Learning, which we will go into below. AI refers to computers systems 
        built to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such as recognition of images, 
        speech or patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster and more accurately
        than humans.
        <br><br>AI has been around since 1956 is already widely used. 
        In fact, five out of six Americans use AI services in one form or another every day, 
        including navigation apps, streaming services, smartphone personal assistants, 
        ride-sharing apps, home personal assistants, and smart home devices. 
        In addition to consumer use, AI is used to schedule trains, assess business risk, 
        predict maintenance, and improve energy efficiency, among many other money-saving tasks.<br><br><br></p></div>

       

          
    <div class="textimg"><h2 class="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" >2. Machine Learning</a></h2>
    <img title="Machine Learning" src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3205208.jpg">
    <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, 
        computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: 
        They literally learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. 
        In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised. <br><br>
    
        While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of 
        Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), 
        and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers an opportunity for specializing 
        in a career field that will only grow. <br><br>

        Machine Learning is rapidly being deployed in all kinds of industries, 
        creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. The Machine Learning 
        market is expected to grow to $8.81 billion by 2022. Machine Learning applications 
        are used for data analytics, data mining and pattern recognition. On the consumer 
        end, Machine Learning powers web search results, real-time ads, and network intrusion
         detection, to name only a few of the many tasks it can do. <br><br>

         In addition to completing countless tasks on our behalf, 
         it is generating jobs. Machine Learning jobs rank among the top 
         emerging jobs on LinkedIn, with almost 2,000 job listings posted. 
         And these jobs pay well: In 2017, the median salary for a machine 
         learning engineer was $106,225. Machine Learning jobs include engineers, 
         developers, researchers, and data scientists. <br><br> <br></p></div>
    

     
    <div class="textimg"><h2 class="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation" >3. Robotic Process Automation or RPA</a></h2>
    <img title="Robotics" src="https://aithority.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kryon_-Leading-Innovator-of-Robotic-Process-Automation-and-Process-Discovery_-Raises-_40-Million.jpg">
    <p>Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, 
        or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. 
        RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting 
        applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. 
        RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the 
        menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be 
        automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.<br><br>
    
        Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood 
        of 230 million or more knowledge workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce,
         RPA is also creating new jobs while altering existing jobs. McKinsey finds that less 
         than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated, but about 60 percent can be 
         partially automated.<br><br>
        
         For you as the IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand 
         technology trends, RPA offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, 
         project manager, business analyst, solution architect, and consultant. 
         And these jobs pay well. SimplyHired.com says the average RPA salary is $73,861, 
         but that is the average compiled from salaries for junior-level developers up to 
         senior solution architects, with the top 10 percent earning over $141,000 annually.<br><br><br></p></div>
    
    <div class="textimg"><h2 class="topics"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" >4. Blockchain</a></h2>  
    <img title="Blockchain" src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmfYkUTGYfCFZdQynyFV2c4ync7HqiMMSPnNFQUAaWhjhZ/555.jpg">
    <p>Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies 
        such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the 
        simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take 
        away from or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. 
        Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, 
        blockchains are consensus-driven, as explained in this Forbes article, so no one entity 
        can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to 
        oversee or validate transactions.<br><br>
    
        This heightened security is why blockchain is used for cryptocurrency, 
        and why it can play a significant role in protecting information such as 
        personal medical data. Blockchain could be used to drastically improve the global 
        supply chain, as described here, as well as protect assets such as art and real estate. <br><br>
    
        And as the use of blockchain technology increases, so too does the demand for 
        skilled professionals. In that regard, we are already behind. According to Techcrunch, 
        blockchain-related jobs are the second-fastest growing category of jobs, with 14 job 
        openings for every one blockchain developer. A blockchain developer specializes in 
        developing and implementing architecture and solutions using blockchain technology. 
        The average yearly salary of a blockchain developer is $130,000.<br><br>
    
        The job of a developer is not the only one available in the blockchain space, 
        however. Employers are also looking for software engineers, consultants and 
        project managers. Jobs are available at financial institutions, but also in 
        retail and healthcare, and soon probably manufacturing as well.<br><br><br></p></div>
